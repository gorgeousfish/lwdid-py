    unit: Unit tests, testing individual functions or classes
    stata_alignment: Stata alignment tests, comparing against benchmark results
    paper_validation: Paper validation tests, verifying consistency with paper tables
    monte_carlo: Monte Carlo simulation tests (typically > 30 seconds)
    performance: Performance tests, verifying computational efficiency and memory usage
    benchmark: Performance benchmark tests, verifying optimization targets
