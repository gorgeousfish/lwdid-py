scipy>=1.14,<1.17
statsmodels>=0.14,<1.0
scikit-learn>=1.4,<1.7
matplotlib>=3.7

# Testing dependencies
pytest>=7.0,<9.0

# Known issue: pytest-cov with NumPy 2.x may cause
# "ValueError: _CopyMode.IF_NEEDED is neither True nor False"
# during test collection. This is a known compatibility issue
# between NumPy 2.x and the coverage tool.
#
# Workaround: Run tests without coverage flag:
#   pytest tests/ -v
#
# For coverage in CI, consider using NumPy 1.26.x environment:
#   pip install "numpy>=1.26,<2.0" "pandas>=1.5,<2.0"
